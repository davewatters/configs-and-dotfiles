# A Collection of useful dotfiles & config files

### VS Code Settings
The `vscode` folder contains backups of my VS Code `settings.json` & `keybindings.json` files.  Depending on which OS I use, the user settings files will be located here:
```
macOS:  ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
Linux:  ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json
Windows:  %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json
```
